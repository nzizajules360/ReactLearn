# Role-Based Authentication & Redirect Implementation

## ✅ Features Implemented

### **1. Role-Based Login Redirect**
Users are now automatically redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on their role after logging in.

### **2. Smart Public Route Redirects**
Already logged-in users trying to access public pages (like login) are redirected to their appropriate dashboard.

### **3. Admin Protection**
Non-admin users trying to access admin routes are redirected to the regular user dashboard.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Login Flow**:

```
User logs in → System checks role → Redirects to appropriate page

Regular User:
  Login → Check role: "user" → Redirect to /dashboard

Admin User:
  Login → Check role: "admin" → Redirect to /admin
```

---

## 📝 Implementation Details

### **1. Updated LoginPage.jsx**

**Location**: Lines 121-142 in `src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`

**What Changed**:
```javascript
// BEFORE: All users went to /dashboard
setTimeout(() => {
  navigate('/dashboard');
}, 1000);

// AFTER: Users go to different pages based on role
const isAdmin = userData.role === 'admin';
setSuccess(`Login successful! Redirecting to ${isAdmin ? 'admin panel' : 'dashboard'}...`);

setTimeout(() => {
  if (isAdmin) {
    navigate('/admin');
  } else {
    navigate('/dashboard');
  }
}, 1000);
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Admin users → `/admin` (Admin Panel)
- ✅ Regular users → `/dashboard` (User Dashboard)
- ✅ Success message shows where they're being redirected

---

### **2. Updated PublicRoute Component**

**Location**: Lines 102-125 in `src/App.jsx`

**What Changed**:
```javascript
// BEFORE: All authenticated users went to /dashboard
if (isAuthenticated) {
  return <Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />
}

// AFTER: Users go to different pages based on role
if (isAuthenticated) {
  const redirectTo = user?.role === 'admin' ? '/admin' : '/dashboard'
  return <Navigate to={redirectTo} replace />
}
```

**Result**:
- ✅ If admin tries to access `/login` → Redirects to `/admin`
- ✅ If regular user tries to access `/login` → Redirects to `/dashboard`
- ✅ Prevents logged-in users from seeing login page

---

### **3. Existing AdminRoute Protection**

**Location**: Lines 74-100 in `src/App.jsx`

**Already Working**:
```javascript
// Non-admin users trying to access admin routes
if (user?.role !== 'admin') {
  return <Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />
}
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Only admin users can access `/admin/*` routes
- ✅ Regular users attempting to access admin pages → Redirected to `/dashboard`

---

## 🔐 User Roles

### **Role Assignment**:

**Regular User**:
- Register normally → Role: `"user"`
- Access: Dashboard, Training, Chat, Profile
- Cannot access: Admin panel

**Admin User**:
- Register with secret code: `101010@101010`
- Role: `"admin"`
- Access: Everything (Dashboard, Training, Chat, Admin Panel)
- Can manage: Users, Courses, Metrics, etc.

## 🎭 User Journey Examples

### **Example 1: Regular User Login**

```
1. User goes to /login
2. Enters credentials
3. Clicks "Sign In"
4. System checks role → "user"
5. Message: "Login successful! Redirecting to dashboard..."
6. Redirected to: /dashboard ✅
```

### **Example 2: Admin User Login**

```
1. Admin goes to /login
2. Enters credentials
3. Clicks "Sign In"
4. System checks role → "admin"
5. Message: "Login successful! Redirecting to admin panel..."
6. Redirected to: /admin ✅
```

### **Example 3: Already Logged-In User**

```
Scenario A: Regular user already logged in
- Tries to access /login
- System detects: isAuthenticated = true, role = "user"
- Automatically redirected to: /dashboard ✅

Scenario B: Admin already logged in
- Tries to access /login
- System detects: isAuthenticated = true, role = "admin"
- Automatically redirected to: /admin ✅
```

### **Example 4: Regular User Tries to Access Admin**

```
1. Regular user goes to /admin
2. System checks: user.role !== 'admin'
3. Automatically redirected to: /dashboard ✅
4. Message: "Access Denied" (if implemented)
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### **Test 1: Regular User Login**
```bash
1. Logout if logged in
2. Go to /login
3. Register new user WITHOUT admin code
4. Login with credentials
5. Should redirect to: /dashboard ✅
6. Try going to /admin → Should redirect back to /dashboard ✅
```

### **Test 2: Admin User Login**
```bash
1. Logout if logged in
2. Go to /login
3. Click "Sign Up"
4. Fill in form
5. Enter admin code: 101010@101010
6. Register and login
7. Should redirect to: /admin ✅
8. Try going to /dashboard → Should work ✅
```

### **Test 3: Already Logged-In Redirect**
```bash
# As Regular User:
1. Login as regular user
2. Manually type /login in URL
3. Should auto-redirect to: /dashboard ✅

# As Admin:
1. Login as admin
2. Manually type /login in URL
3. Should auto-redirect to: /admin ✅
```

### **Test 4: Navbar Shows for Logged-In Users**
```bash
1. Login (any role)
2. Navigate to /dashboard → See Navbar ✅
3. Navigate to /training → See Navbar ✅
4. Navigate to /chat → See Navbar ✅
5. Logout → Navbar gone on public pages ✅
```

## 🎨 Updated Logo

### **Navbar & Footer**:
Both now use your custom logo from `/logo.svg`:
```jsx
<img src="/logo.svg" alt="EcoSwarm" className="w-6 h-6" />
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Hexagonal swarm design
- ✅ Green gradients matching brand
- ✅ Consistent across Navbar and Footer
- ✅ Softer background color for better visibility

---

## 🔍 Debugging

### **Check User Role**:
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log(localStorage.getItem('user'));
// Should show: {"id":1,"name":"John","email":"john@example.com","role":"admin"}
```

### **Check Authentication**:
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('Token:', localStorage.getItem('token'));
console.log('User:', localStorage.getItem('user'));
```

### **Force Role Change** (For testing):
```javascript
// In browser console - Change role temporarily
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));
user.role = 'admin'; // or 'user'
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));
// Refresh page
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### **Admin Secret Code**:
Location: `backend/server.js` line 57
```javascript
const ADMIN_SECRET_CODE = '101010@101010'
```

To change it:
1. Update in `backend/server.js`
2. Update in your documentation
3. Tell your admins the new code

---

## 🚨 Security Notes

### **Current Implementation**:
- ✅ JWT token authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Protected routes on frontend
- ✅ Backend middleware checks role

### **Backend Protection** (Already in place):
```javascript
// backend/server.js
app.get('/api/admin/users', authMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  // Check if user is admin
  const [meRows] = await pool.query('SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = ?', [req.user.id])
  if (!meRows[0] || meRows[0].role !== 'admin') {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden' })
  }
  // ... admin logic
})
```

**Important**: Frontend route protection is for UX. Backend MUST also validate roles.
