# Course Upload & Creation Fixes - Oct 30, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ TrainingLayout Syntax Error
**Error**: `Unexpected token. Did you mean '{'}'}' or '&rbrace;'?`

**Cause**: Missing closing `</header>` tag and extra closing `</div>` tag

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added proper indentation to header div
- Removed duplicate closing div
- Properly closed outer container div before fragment

**File**: `Learn/src/pages/training/TrainingLayout.jsx`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Image Upload "Unexpected Token" Error  
**Error**: Failed to upload - unexpected token in JSON response

**Cause**: Manually setting `'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'` header in axios requests. When you manually set this header, it doesn't include the required `boundary` parameter that separates form fields.

**Fix Applied**: Removed manual Content-Type headers from all file upload functions. Axios automatically sets the correct Content-Type with boundary when you pass FormData.

**Files Fixed**:
- `Learn/src/components/admin/CourseFormModal.jsx` (thumbnail upload)
- `Learn/src/components/admin/LessonFormModal.jsx` (video upload & PDF upload)

**Before**:
```javascript
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'  // ‚ùå WRONG - missing boundary
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`  // ‚úÖ Axios adds Content-Type automatically
}
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Courses Not Being Created/Saved
**Issue**: Courses weren't appearing in browser after creation

**Cause**: Lack of error visibility - errors were happening but not being logged or displayed properly

**Fix Applied**: Enhanced error handling and logging in course save function

**File**: `Learn/src/pages/admin/CoursesManagementPage.jsx`

**Changes**:
```javascript
// Added token validation
if (!token) {
  showMessage('error', 'No authentication token found. Please login again.');
  return;
}

// Added console logging for debugging
console.log('Saving course to:', url);
console.log('Course data:', courseData);

// Better error messages
const errorMsg = error.response?.data?.message || error.message || 'Unknown error';
showMessage('error', `Failed to create course: ${errorMsg}`);
```

## How File Upload Works Now

### **Step 1: User Selects File**
```javascript
<input type="file" onChange={(e) => handleFileUpload(e, 'thumbnail')} />
```

### **Step 2: Create FormData**
```javascript
const formDataUpload = new FormData();
formDataUpload.append('file', file);
formDataUpload.append('type', 'thumbnail');  // or 'video', 'pdf'
```

### **Step 3: Upload to Backend**
```javascript
const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/api/admin/upload`, formDataUpload, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    // NO Content-Type header - axios sets it automatically!
  }
});
```

### **Step 4: Backend Receives File**
```javascript
// backend/server.js
app.post('/api/admin/upload', authMiddleware, courseUpload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
  const type = req.body.type || 'general'
  const url = `/uploads/${type}/${req.file.filename}`
  return res.json({ url })
})
```

### **Step 5: Update Form with URL**
```javascript
const fileUrl = response.data.url;
setFormData({ ...formData, thumbnail: fileUrl });
```

---

## How Course Creation Works Now

### **Frontend Flow**:
```
1. Admin fills course form
2. Uploads thumbnail image ‚Üí Gets URL back
3. Clicks "Create Course"
4. CourseFormModal calls onSave(formData)
5. CoursesManagementPage.saveCourse() is called
6. Axios POST to /api/admin/courses
7. Success ‚Üí Fetch courses list ‚Üí Close modal
8. Error ‚Üí Display error message
```

### **Backend Flow**:
```
1. Receives POST to /api/admin/courses
2. Checks user is admin
3. Extracts course data from req.body
4. Inserts into MySQL courses table:
   - title, description, category, level
   - duration, price, instructor
   - topics (JSON), learningObjectives (JSON)
   - requirements (JSON), certificate
   - thumbnail URL
5. Returns created course with ID
```

### **Database**:
```sql
INSERT INTO courses (
  title, description, category, level, duration, 
  price, instructor, topics, learning_objectives, 
  requirements, certificate, thumbnail
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
```

## Testing the Fixes

### **Test 1: Upload Course Thumbnail**
```
1. Login as admin
2. Go to /admin/courses
3. Click "Add Course"
4. Click thumbnail upload button
5. Select an image file (JPG, PNG)
6. Should see "File uploaded successfully" alert
7. Image preview should appear
8. Check console for: "File uploaded successfully: http://..."
```

### **Test 2: Create New Course**
```

   - Duration: "4 weeks"
   - Price: 50
   - Instructor: "Test Instructor"
   - Add some topics and objectives
2. Click "Create Course" button
3. Check console for logs:
   - "Saving course to: http://localhost:3001/api/admin/courses"
   - "Course data: {...}"
   - "Course saved successfully: {...}"
4. Should see success message: "Course created successfully"
5. Course should appear in courses list
6. Verify in database: SELECT * FROM courses;
```

### **Test 3: Upload Lesson Video**
```
1. Select a course
2. Click "Add Lesson"

## Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue**: "No file uploaded" error
**Solution**: Make sure file input has correct name and accepts correct types
```html
<input 
  type="file" 
  accept="image/*" 
  onChange={(e) => handleFileUpload(e, 'thumbnail')} 
/>
```

### **Issue**: "Access denied" error
**Solution**: Make sure user is logged in as admin
```javascript
// Check localStorage
console.log('Token:', localStorage.getItem('token'));
console.log('User:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')));
// User should have role: 'admin'
```

### **Issue**: "Failed to fetch courses" after creation
**Solution**: Check backend logs, verify database connection
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:3001/api/training/courses

# Check database
mysql -u root -p
USE ecoswarm;
SELECT * FROM courses;
```

### **Issue**: Thumbnail not displaying
**Solution**: 
1. Check uploads folder exists: `backend/uploads/thumbnail/`
2. Check file was actually uploaded
3. Check URL is correct: should be `http://localhost:3001/uploads/thumbnail/filename.jpg`
4. Make sure backend serves static files:
```javascript
app.use('/uploads', express.static(path.join(process.cwd(), 'backend', 'uploads')))
```

```

### **Successful Course Creation**:
```
Saving course to: http://localhost:3001/api/admin/courses
Course data: {title: "Test Course", description: "...", ...}
Course saved successfully: {id: 1, title: "Test Course", ...}
```

### **Error Examples**:
```
Upload error: Error: Request failed with status code 401
// Solution: Login again

Error saving course: Error: Network Error
// Solution: Check backend is running

Error saving course: Failed to create course: Access denied

## Backend Logs to Watch For

```bash
# Successful upload
POST /api/admin/upload 201 - - 1234.567 ms

# Successful course creation
POST /api/admin/courses 201 - - 89.123 ms

# Error logs
Error creating course: Error: ER_NO_SUCH_TABLE: Table 'ecoswarm.courses' doesn't exist
# Solution: Run database migrations

Upload error: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'uploads/thumbnail'
# Solution: Create uploads directories
```

## Database Verification

After creating a course, verify in database:

```sql
-- Check course was created
SELECT * FROM courses ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check all courses
SELECT id, title, category, price, thumbnail FROM courses;

-- Check lessons for a course
SELECT * FROM lessons WHERE course_id = 1;
```
